# variable-force-servo-controller
BME 385 Project for controlling a servo motor with variable force.

This was a small project that involved controlling a servo-motor based on the amount of force placed on a sensor. This FSR (variable resistance), was placed into a wheatstone bridged, amplifed through an Instrumentation Amplfier and filtered through a Sallen-Key 4th-Ordered Butterworth Lowpass Filter at 20 Hz.  This signal was then processed in an arduino, which drove the servo motor.
